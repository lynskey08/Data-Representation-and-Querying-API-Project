## County Galway Libraries

### Introduction
This project provides information and the documentation for the datasets of Galway Libraries throughout the County, which i found available online at [https://data.gov.ie/dataset/county-galway-libraries](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/county-galway-libraries).
I would imagine the target user(s) for this app would be regular goers of the library such as Adults and Students. 

The idea of this app is to make it easy and convenient for users to find a library nearby around the county when they aren't close to their own local library.

### About
I downloaded the dataset from [https://data.gov.ie/dataset/county-galway-libraries](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/county-galway-libraries) in a Comma Seperated Value format(.csv). The file has 30 rows which contain the names of the individual Libraries and 24 columns which contain the information of each Library.I have decided to use 17 of the 24 columns and to leave out the rest of the columns as they don't contain relevent information needed for the app.
