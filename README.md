### Introduction
This project provides information and the documentation for the datasets of Galway Libraries throughout the County, which i found available online at [https://data.gov.ie/dataset/county-galway-libraries](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/county-galway-libraries).
I would imagine the target user(s) for this app would be regular goers of the library such as Adults and Students.
